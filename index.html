        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 160 degrees celsius with a shelf in the middle
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pile strawberries on a tray. Sprinkle over sugar. Toss through, then spread strawberries out on tray. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Roast for 45 minutes, rotating tray halfway. Remove from oven, toss strawberries, then return to oven for 15 minutes. Keep an eye on it </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove from oven, use spatula to scrape into a food processor, being sure to get all the juices and caramelised bits off the tray.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Blitz until smooth as possible (caramelised bits won't blitz smooth), scrape into bowl then cool completely.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add condensed milk and vanilla into strawberries. Beat well for 1 1/2 minutes on high to aerate and combine. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place cream in another bowl. Use electric beater to beat into stiff peaks - about 3 minutes on high. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Add a dollop of cream into the strawberry mixture. Fold through gently, don't beat in furiously When mostly mixed through, add another dollop and for through about 5 times. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Tip strawberry mixture into the cream bowl. Gently fold through until it's a uniform pink colour - about 15 to 20 folds max. Some streaks is ok. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Pour mixture into a container (preferably glass with airtight lid), smooth top. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Place sheet of baking paper on surface and press out air bubbles (stops icicles forming). Cover with lid, freeze 12+ hours. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Remove from freezer, remove paper. Scoop with ice cream scooper and serve in cones or bowls! </p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Separate eggs and yolks while eggs are cold. Place whites in a large bowl and yolks in a small bowl. Leave whites while you prepare other ingredients.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Whisk egg yolks. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place chocolate and butter in a bowl. Melt in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside to cool </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Beat cream until stiff peaks form
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add sugar. Beat whites until firm peaks form
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Fold egg yolks into cream using a rubber spatula - 8 folds max. Streaks is ok. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Touch the chocolate. Should still be runny but only lukewarm. If too thick, microwave 2 x 3 seconds until runny. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Pour chocolate into cream yolk mixture. Fold through - 8 folds max. Streaks ok. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Add 1/4 of beaten egg whites into chocolate mixture. Fold through until incorporated - "smear" the spatular across surface to blend white lumps in - aim for 10 folds. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Pour chocolate mixture into egg whites. Fold through until incorporated and no more white lumps remain - aim for 12 folds max. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Divide mixture between 4 small glasses or pots. Refrigerate for at least 5 hours, preferably overnight. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> To serve, garnish with cream and chocolate shavings. Raspberries and a tiny sprig of mint for colour would also be lovely! </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Beat yolks and sugar in stand mixer or electric beater on speed 6 to 7 for 10 minutes or until it changes from yellow to pale yellow (almost white), and is thick (see video for consistency).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add vanilla and mascarpone, beat until just combined and smooth. Transfer mixture to a bowl, set aside </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Clean bowl and whisk. Add egg whites and beat until it's stiff (3 minutes on speed 7)</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add 1/2 the cream mixture into the egg whites. Gently fold through. When most incorporated, add the remaining cream mixture and fold through until just combined - don't bash out all the air in the egg whites! 
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Mix coffee and liquor together. Quickly dip biscuits in and line the bottom of a 8”/20cm square dish.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Spread over half the cream, then top with another layer of coffee dipped biscuits. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Spread with remaining cream.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Cover, refrigerate for at least 4 - 5 hours, preferably overnight </p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Dust with cocoa powder just before serving - either before you cut or after placing onto serving plates. </p>

        <h3>Method</h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 120C/250F (standard) or 100C/210F (fan/convection).
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mark 2 rectangles 11 x 40 cm / 4.5 x 15" on a sheet of baking paper using pencil, with 2.5cm / 1" between each outline. Repeat with another sheet of paper (so 4 outlines). </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Find 2 baking trays large enough so the outline fits on the tray surface when the tray is turned upside down (rim gets in way of piping). </p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Fit a large piping bag with a 11mm / 0.5" round nozzle
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Separate the egg whites while the eggs are fridge cold.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Place whites in a large clean, dry bowl. Whip until it all turns into foam and there's no liquid whites left (1 minute on speed 8) </p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> With the beater still going, add the sugar one heaped tablespoon at a time - about 1 minute. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> After the sugar is added, crank the beater up to speed 10 and whip for 1 minute. Fluff should be glossy and when you rub between fingers, there should be barely any sugar grit - a bit is ok. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Spoon half the meringue into piping bag </p>
        <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Dab small amount on the corner of an upside down baking tray. Place paper on tray pencil marking side down. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Pipe filling inside the lines - don't worry if there are gaps. Use dessert spoon to smooth surface - the base should be about 1/2 cm thick (rises to ~7 mm cooked). </p>
        <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Pipe blobs along one short end (to make tart ends) and all along both long sides. Do this to both on Tray 1. Place in oven. </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Repeat with remaining meringues on Tray 2, but do not pipe blobs along the short end (these will be the middle pieces). Place in oven on shelf just below Tray 1. </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Use any remaining meringue to make extra small blobs (good for repairs / decoration / nibbling). Place this tray on the floor of oven.
 </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Bake for 45 minutes, then swap the two trays (tray with blobs not a priority, leave it!).
 </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 16:</strong> Bake for further 30 minutes, then turn off the oven, keep door closed and leave to cool (can keep in oven even for days). Meringue should be dry and crisp, able to lift off paper.
 </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Place cream, vanilla and sugar in a bowl and whip until soft peaks form.
 </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Trim joining ends of meringues with knife so they are straight.
 </p> 
        <p><strong>Step 19:</strong> Dab cream on cut end and join meringues. Assemble where you plan to serve.
 </p>  
        <p><strong>Step 20:</strong> Spread over cream, top with fruit, dust with sugar. Serve immediately, and puff up with pride when lavished with compliments!

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to the 230 degrees celsius
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Line a 6-inch cake pan with 2.5-inch sides with baking paper. If the pan has a removable bottom, you can use the bottom to press the paper into the pan. Then you can use your hands to crease the sides to hold its shape. Once the paper is molded to the pan, you can remove the bottom and the paper and then reattach the bottom to the pan, placing the paper on top. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add all of the ingredients to a blender and blend until smooth</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour the mixture into the prepared cake pan</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake the cheesecake until the top is just shy of turning black. The cake should still be very jiggly in the center when you remove it from the oven. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Let the cheesecake cool on a cooling rack and then place it in a sealable container and refrigerate overnight.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Slice and serve with fruit (optional)</p>

    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 160C/320F (standard) or 140C/295F (fan/convection)
</p>
    <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Get a 20cm/8″ springform cake tin. Turn the base upside down, butter lightly and place a square piece of parchment/baking paper on the base. Then clip into the springform pan – excess paper will stick out. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Butter and line the side of the pan.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Cheesecake biscuit base</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Break up biscuits roughly by hand and place in a food processor.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Blitz until fine crumbs. Add butter, briefly blitz until dispersed and it resembles wet sand. </p>
    <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Pour into the prepared cake tin. Use a spatula to roughly spread it out over the base and up the walls.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Use something with a flat base and vertical edges (e.g. measuring cup) to press the crumbs up the wall almost to the top of the sides, and flatten the base.</p>
    <p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Use a mixer or beater to beat the cream cheese until just smooth, no longer than 20 seconds on speed 4. (Do not aerate cheesecake filling as it causes cracks when it bakes)</p>
    <p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Add flour, beat for 5 seconds on speed 4 until just incorporated.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Add vanilla, sour cream, sugar and lemon zest. Beat until just combined (10 sec max, speed 5).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Add eggs one at a time, beat in between until just combined (5 sec each), and after the last one, beat just until the egg is fully incorporated.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Pour into prepared crust.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Bake for 55 minutes. The top should be a very light golden brown, not cracked, and near perfectly flat. It should jiggle slightly when you gently shake the pan.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Cool the cake in the oven with the door open 20 cm / 8", then refrigerate for 4 hours+ in the pan.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Remove sides. Use overhang paper to slide cheesecake off the cake pan. Then slide the cheesecake off the paper.</p>
    <p><strong>Strawberry topping</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Step 16:</strong> Place chopped strawberries, vanilla, sugar and lemon juices in a saucepan. Stir then bring to simmer over medium heat.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 17:</strong> Simmer for 10 minutes until strawberries breakdown.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 18:</strong> Mix cornflour with water, then add into saucepan and stir.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 19:</strong> Add halved strawberries and cook for 1 minute to soften.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 20:</strong> Sauce should be syrupy – remove from stove and cool. Will thicken as it cools.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 21:</strong> Once cooled, stir. Adjust thickness to make it the right “oozing” consistency with a tiny touch of water (be careful!).</p>
    <p><strong>Step 22:</strong> Spoon onto cheesecake so it’s covered with a single layer of strawberries. Flip strawberry halves so they are facedown. Refrigerate 2 hours+.</p>
    <p><strong>Step 23:</strong> Slice and serve with remaining Strawberry Sauce!</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place butter in a saucepan over medium heat. When mostly melted, add water then bring to a rapid simmer.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While liquid is simmering, add flour and pinch of salt, and stir vigorously with a wooden spoon (still on stove) until the dough forms sort of a ball and pulls away from the sides of the saucepan. About 1 minute. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove from heat and let mixture cool for 10 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Preheat oven to 220°C/420°F (200°C fan).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lightly grease 2 large or 3 standard baking trays with butter, then line with paper. (Grease stops paper sliding) </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add 1 egg into batter, beat until combined. Add remaining eggs one at a time making sure each is combined before adding the next. Dough should be like a thick paste.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place dough into a piping bag fitted with a 13 – 15mm round tip (1/2 – 3/5").</p>
<p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Pipe 2 tsp blobs 5cm/2" apart (I do 16 on each tray). Makes 40 – 50 blobs.</p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Wet your finger with water and pat down any peaks to form domes (for nice round balls).</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Bake 2 trays at a time for 15 minutes, switching the trays halfway.</p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Remove from oven, reduce heat to 180°C/35°0F (160°C fan). They should be crispy enough that when pierced, they will not collapse – if not, return to oven for 3 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Pierce balls with knife then return to oven for 5 – 7 minutes until golden and crispy.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Transfer to rack, cool fully before filling with custard, cream or split then fill with ice cream. Drizzle with chocolate and serve!</p>
<p><strong>Chocolate topping</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place cream and chocolate in a heatproof bowl. Microwave 4 x 30 seconds, stirring in between, until incorporated. Cool to warm, then use for drizzling or dipping.</p>
<p><strong>Custard filling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk yolks and sugar, then whisk in cornflour.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place milk, vanilla and extra sugar in a saucepan over medium high. Heat until just before simmering.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Whisk in 1/4 cup hot milk into egg mixture. Whisk in another 1/4 cup. Then add remaining milk mixture and whisk.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Pour back into saucepan. Return to stove on medium low (low for strong stoves). Whisk constantly 2 to 3 minutes until the mixture thicks to a thick dolloping custard consistency.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Remove from heat immediately, pour into bowl. Press cling wrap onto surface (stops skin forming) then refrigerate for 4 to 5 hours until set. Do not whisk again once set (loses thickness).</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Spoon into piping bag fitting with a very fine nozzle. Then pipe into profiteroles (use the hole pierced during bake, or make a new hole).</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven at 375 degrees Fahrenheit. Grease the bottom and the sides of two 20-cm diameter with melted butter. Cover the bottom and sides of both pans with parchment paper, and grease the parchment papers once again with melted butter. Set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a large mixing bowl, mix the softened butter and granulated sugar using an electric mixer until well combined and soft. Add in the egg yolks and continue mixing using the electric mixer until well combined and creamy.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> In a separate bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, baking powder, and matcha powder using a whisk. Pass the mixture through a sieve to make it uniform. Add the flour mixture into the butter-sugar-egg yolk mixture 1-2 tablespoons at a time and fold using a rubber spatula until they are well combined. If the batter is too dry to fold, add a couple of tablespoons of milk to moisten it up.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites using an electric mixer until it reaches soft peaks. Add the egg whites 1/3 at a time into the cake batter and fold gently using a rubber spatula.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Pour half of the cake batter into one baking pan, and the other half into the other baking pan. Bake at 375 degrees Fahrenheit for 12-15 minutes. To check, stick a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out clean, then the cake is ready. When the cakes are baked, remove immediately from the pans and let cool at room temperature. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> To make the white chocolate frosting, mix together the butter, confectioner's sugar, melted white chocolate, salt, and milk in a large mixing bowl using an electric mixer until well combined and creamy. Refrigerate if it's not being used immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> To assemble the cake, place one cake layer on a flat surface and spread the frosting on top. Place another cake layer on top of the frosting. Finish by covering the top and sides with frosting. Top with matcha powder.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat the oven to 180C and lightly grease a baking tray.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Put the apple, lemon juice, sugar and breadcrumbs in a large bowl, and mix well. </p>

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lay one sheet filo pastry horizontally on a work surface and brush with melted butter. Lay another sheet over it so that it overlaps the first sheet on the edge furthest from you by 5cm. Brush the second sheet then sprinkle with a quarter of the almond mixture. Repeat until you have used all the filo and almond mixture. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Place the apple mixture along the edge closest to you, leaving a 4cm border on three sides. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Carefully roll up, folding the sides over about halfway, then roll to the end.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Place the strudel on the prepared baking tray, seam-side-down. Brush with melted butter and bake for 40 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown.</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve with cream or ice-cream.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Cupcakes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan). Line a standard 12 hole muffin tin with cupcake liners.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Sift dry ingredients together into a bowl. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Put the butter in a separate bowl and beat on speed 2 for 1 minute with an electric mixer or stand mixer (paddle attachment).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add sugar then beat for a further 2 minutes, same speed, until the butter is very pale yellow, almost white.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add the eggs one at a time beating for 30 seconds on speed 1 after each addition. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add oil, buttermilk, vanilla and red food colouring then beat on Speed 1 until incorporated and the batter is smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Sprinkle the dry ingredients across the surface and mix on Speed 1 for just 20 seconds. Scrape down sides of the bowl, then mix again for 10 seconds. The batter should now be smooth – few small lumps is ok. Do not keep beating – overworks batter = cupcakes not as soft! </p>
<p><strong>Filling</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Divide the batter between the 12 cupcake liners – it should fill 3/4 of the way, but it depends on the size of the cupcake liners you use. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Bake for 20 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the middle cupcake comes out clean.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Immediately remove cupcakes onto a wire rack. Cool completely before frosting with cream cheese frosting.</p>
<p><strong>Frosting</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Place butter in a bowl and beat for 1 minute until it's smooth and starts to become paler in colour – speed 6 on stand mixer, speed 9 for electric beater.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Add cream cheese then beat for a further 1 minute on the same speed until smooth.</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Add icing sugar in 4 batches, beating in between until incorporated, starting on speed 1 so you don't get a dust storm in your face! </p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Add vanilla and salt, then beat for 2 minutes until fluffy – speed 6 with stand mixer, speed 9 with electric beater. It should be creamy but still hold its shape in a peak. If it's too sloppy, place in fridge for 30 minutes, then beat again. </p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Transfer into piping bag with desired piping tip. Pipe onto cupcakes – makes enough to generously frost 12 cupcakes.</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> Serve!</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 180°C/350°F (160°C fan forced).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Spray a 20cm/8" square tin with oil and line with baking/parchment paper with overhang. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Place butter and chocolate chips in a heatproof bowl, microwave in 30 second bursts (takes me 1m 30 sec) until melted. Stir until smooth.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add sugar and vanilla, mix, then add eggs and mix well until smooth and molten. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add flour, cocoa and salt and stir until smooth. Stir in chopped chocolate, pour into pan. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake 24 minutes for really gooey in the centre, 28 minutes for fudgey but still very moist, 32 minutes for moist fudge-cake-like.</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> If you didn't use the extra chocolate for stirring in, reduce cook time by 2 minutes. </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Rest for 10 minutes before lifting out of the pan. Allow to cool for at least 20 minutes before cutting. Serve with whipped cream, ice cream or whatever other topping. </p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Fast soaked fruit</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place dried fruit and juice in a large microwavable container. Microwave 1 1/2 minutes on high or until hot.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Stir to coat all fruit in liquid. Cover then set aside for 1 hour (to plump up/soak and cool). </p>
<p><strong>Cake</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat oven to 160°C / 320°F (140°C fan). Grease and line a 21 – 22 cm / 8 – 9" round cake pan with baking paper (parchment paper) (7 cm / 2.75" tall).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Using an electric beater, beat butter and sugar until smooth and creamy (about 1 minute on speed 5).</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add oil and golden syrup, beat until combined. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Add salt, spices and baking powder – beat until incorporated. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Add eggs, one at a time, beating until just incorporated. </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Stir in the flour. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> When mostly incorporated, stir in the fruit mix (including all the extra liquid in bowl) and walnuts (if using). </p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Pour into cake pan, cover with foil and bake for 3 hours 15 minutes, removing foil the last 45 minutes. Skewer inserted into middle should come out clean with no batter on it. </p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Remove from oven and cool for 20 minutes before transferring to cooling rack. Cool completely before serving. </p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Cake is moist and so full flavoured, it can be eaten plain. But see below for decorating and serving ideas (traditionally served with pouring custard).</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Either cut into thin wedges, or cut cake into thin strips (2cm / 0.75" or so), then cut those strips into serving size pieces. </p>
<p><strong>Christmas Cake Decorating Options</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Traditional White Christmas Cake - </strong> Marzipan and fondant, roll out and then drape over cake, then stretch and press to cover sides </p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Simple - </strong> Pile top with fresh cherries or other fruit, dust with icing sugar (powdered sugar). Wrap a ribbon around the cake for extra touch! </p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Drippy white glaze - </strong> Flip cake upside down for flat surface then glaze per glaze recipe. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Serving - </strong> serve with custard for a traditional experience! Either homemade custard or store bought pouring custard (jazz it up by mixing in vanilla seed paste!).</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Separate the whites and yolks while eggs are cold. Measure 150 ml/5oz egg whites (140 - 160ml is ok).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Set whites aside to come to room temperature. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat oven to 150C/300F (fan / convection) / 170C/340F (standard).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Place whites in a bowl. Use a stand mixer (I use speed 7) or handheld beater (high) and beat until soft peaks form </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add sugar 1 tbsp at a time, beating as you go. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> After adding the sugar, beat for a further 3 minutes or until thick and glossy. Rub a little of the fluff between your fingers, there should be no sugar grit - that means it is ready. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Add cornflour and vinegar, beat on low for 5 - 7 seconds (or fold through with spatula) until just mixed through. </p>
<p><strong>Making the pavlova</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Get the base of a springform cake pan (24cm/9.5" or larger) and turn it upside down. Dab meringue on the edge and place a piece of baking paper (parchment paper) on top. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Gently place half the fluff onto the paper. Use the cake pan as a guide to make it round and coax it into a circle shape around 20cm / 8" in diameter. </p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Carefully scoop out the remaining fluff. Now coax it into a dome shape (not a cake with straight smooth sides) with edges sloping in slightly. Flatten top. Make it 4-5cm / 2 " high - not much higher. </p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Transfer to baking tray. CAREFULLY place in the oven, GENTLY close the door and turn oven DOWN to 100C/210F (fan / convection) / 115C/240F (standard).</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Bake for 1 1/2 hours</p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Turn oven off, leave the door closed and leave pavlova in the oven overnight to cool</p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Transfer pavlova to serving platter then slide cake pan out from underneath. Use butter knife if required to loosen edges from paper, then slide paper out from underneath.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Just before serving, top with cream and fruit of choice.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong>Serve!</p>
<p><strong>Topping</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place cream, sugar and vanilla in a bowl. Beat cream until it is thickened and just holds its shape - don't overbeat, it should be silky smooth, not speckled with bubbles and stiff.</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Cinnamon sugar coating</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Combine sugar and cinnamon in a shallow bowl, set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Batter</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Mix flour, baking powder and salt in a bowl. Add oil and water and mix until just combined - it should be a thick, gummy batter, like a wet sticky dough, not thin and watery. </p>
<p><strong>Piping bag</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Transfer dough into a piping bag with a 8mm / 1/3" star tip nozzle. Set aside while oil heats. </p>
<p><strong>Cooking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Heat 5cm / 2" oil over medium high in a small pot, wok or small but deep skillet (Note 3) to 170°C/340°F, or until it takes 20 seconds for a small cube of bread to turn golden. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Pipe 15cm / 6" lengths of dough into the oil, snipping with scissors (snip close to oil surface to avoid splash). Do 3 to 4 per batch, makes 10 to 12 in total. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Cook for 2-3 minutes or until golden and crisp, rolling occasionally. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Remove onto paper towel lined plate to drain. Then roll in sugar. Serve hot with Chocolate Sauce! </p>
<p><strong>Chocolate sauce</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place in a heatproof bowl and microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, until smooth. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool and thicken slightly.

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 160C/325F (standard) or 150C/300F (fan forced / convection).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Butter and line a 31.5 x 23.5 cm / 9 x 13" pan with baking paper with overhang. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat butter until smooth (or use very soft butter and a wooden spoon). Add icing sugar and beat until combined.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add half the flour and beat until mostly combined – it will resemble wet sand. Then beat in the remainder. Use your hands to bring it together into a smooth ball of dough – knead lightly if required. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Roughly press down into a rectangle shape, then transfer into the pan. Press into the pan. Optional: Roll over the top using a small rolling pin or glass for a smooth surface. Don’t press down too hard – it makes the cookies firmer </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake for 20 minutes until edges are very light golden and most of the surface is still pale gold. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Remove from the oven. Working quickly, cut into desired shape (For example 8 x 3 bars, like Walker’s shortbread biscuits) and prick all over with a fork (optional). </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Return to the oven for 8 minutes or until the surface is light golden – not browned. Turn the oven off, crack it open ajar, then leave to cool for at least 1 hour in the oven. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Remove from the oven, use paper overhang to remove the biscuits from the pan. Cool fully on rack. Serve with tea!!</p>

    </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place butter, salt and both sugars in a bowl. Beat on speed 5 for 1 minute until it's soft, creamy and fluffy.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add yolks and vanilla - beat for 1 minute until well incorporated.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add baking powder, rice flour and half the plain flour. Beat until you can't see flour anymore, then add remaining flour and beat again until incorporated.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Mixture will be fairly clump and thick, but if you press between your fingers, it should stick together (rather than being dry and crumbly). </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use a wooden spoon to stir chocolate through. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Tip out onto a work surface then press together into a 22cm / 9" log. Wrap in cling wrap or paper, twisting to seal the ends. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Refrigerate 1.5 - 2 hours. </p>
<p><strong>Baking</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Line 2 trays with baking/parchment paper. Put one shelf in the middle of the oven, and the other underneath.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove from fridge, unwrap. </p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use a serrated knife to slice into 1.75cm / 2/3" thick slices. Saw carefully through choc chunks. If it falls apart on edges, just press if back together, no big deal. Place 6 on each tray.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Bake 10 minutes. Turn oven down to 170°C/340°F (150°C fan), switch trays. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Bake for a further 15 minutes until surface is light golden and edges are a bit golden. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Remove from oven and cool completely on trays - this makes them crunchy.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Serve!

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 200C/390F (standard) or 180C/350F (fan / convection).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place flour in food processor, then butter. Blitz on high for 8 seconds until it resembles breadcrumbs. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pour milk all over the flour (don't pour in one place). Blitz for 6 to 8 seconds on high until the crumbs turn into ball(s).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Transfer dough onto work surface, scrape out residual bits in the food processor. </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Knead lightly no more than 10 times just to bring the dough together into one smooth ball, then pat down into a 2 cm / 4/5" thick disc. Dust with extra flour if necessary </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Optional: Lightly roll across the top with a rolling pin to smooth the top. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Dip a 5 cm / 2" round cutter into Extra Flour. </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Plunge cutter straight down and back out into dough - do not twist. Repeat all over disc. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Remove excess dough from around scones, then carefully transfer scones onto baking tray, taking care not to smear / press the cut sides.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Gather together dough scraps and repeat. </p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Brush tops lightly with milk. (Optional) </p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Bake for 10 to 12 minutes until the top is golden and it sounds hollow when tapped. </p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Remove from oven, then transfer onto dish towel and wrap loosely (makes top soft). </p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Once cooled to warm (10 - 15 minutes), serve warm.
</p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Beat butter, sugar and salt on medium (speed 5) using a hand held mixer for 1 minute until smooth.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Add egg yolks and vanilla, beat for 1 minute or until smooth. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add baking powder, rice flour and half the plain flour. Beat with mixer on medium speed until flour is incorporated.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add remaining flour and beat with mixer until flour is incorporated. Add macadamia nuts and chocolate, then mix through with a wooden spoon (dough gets a bit too hard to use mixer). </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Scrape mixture onto a work surface, press together and shape into a 22cm/9" log. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Roll up in baking paper or cling wrap, twist ends then refrigerate for 2 hours. </p>
<p><strong>Slice and bake</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 200°C/390°F (180°C fan). </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Line 2 trays with baking paper. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Remove log from fridge, unwrap and slice into 1.75cm / 3/4" thick slices (12 - 13 cookies).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Place 6 on each tray, bake for 10 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Turn oven down to 170°C/340°F (150°C fan), switch the trays between shelves.

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place Batter ingredients in a blender. Pulse 10 times, or until smooth and lump free.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Place Batter in fridge for 1 hour. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a non stick skillet over medium high heat. Add 1/4 tsp butter and melt.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add 1/4 cup batter and quickly swirl to spread. Cook the first side for 1 minute or until there are light golden brown patches. Flip and cook the other side for 30 seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Slide out of the skillet onto a tray / board. Repeat with remaining crepes, overlapping them into the board.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Spread Nutella onto crepe - as much as you want! Cover half the crepe with strawberry slices, then fold into half then into quarters. Transfer to plate. Sprinkle with icing sugar and serve with extra strawberries! </p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Preparation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place Apple Pie Filling, sugar and cinnamon in the food processor and whizz until smooth.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Working quickly so the pastry does not defrost, place one sheet of pastry on a cutting board or other flat surface. Spread the filling over the pastry, leaving a thin border. Place the other sheet on top. Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with sugar granules (if using) then place the pastry in the freezer for at least 1 hour. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Preheat oven to 180C/350F. Spray large baking tray with oil (or 2 small ones).

</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Remove pastry from the freezer. Let it defrost for 5 to 10 minutes, until the pastry is softened - it doesn't need to thaw completely but it can't be frozen stiff otherwise it will crack when you cut it. DO NOT let the pie filling defrost! </p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Use a large knife to cut it into "fries". I cut mine into 12 strips vertically (2cm / 4/5" wide) then 3 horizontally (8cm/3" long) to make 36 fries. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Carefully transfer to baking tray and set them aside to come to room temperature while the oven heats up. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Bake for 15 to 25 minutes, until golden brown on top.  </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Remove from oven, let it rest for 5 minutes then transfer to cooking rack. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Serve with Salted Caramel Sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Salted caramel sauce</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place sugar and water in a small saucepan over high heat. Swirl the pan to help the sugar dissolve easily but do not stir. Let it come to a rapid simmer and cook for around 3 to 4 minutes until it turns a light golden brown. </p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Remove from heat and CAREFULLY and slowly pour the cream in (it will bubble and froth slightly pour slowly). Whisk to combine. Then add the salt and butter and whisk again. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Serve with Apple Pie Fries. </p>

<h3>Method</h3>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Whisk dry ingredients on one bowl
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together using a stand mixer or electric beater on speed 7 for 2 minutes, or until light and fluffy. </p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Add the egg and vanilla, then mix on speed 5 until combined (~30 sec).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Add the molasses, mix for 1 minute using speed 2.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Add 1/4 of the Dry ingredients, then mix until you can't see flour (start on speed 1 to stop flour flying everywhere!). Repeat until all Dry ingredients are mixed in, then mix for further 15 seconds. Dough should be soft and a bit sticky. </p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Pat dough into a disc shape, wrap in the cling wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or until firm. </p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C (170°C fan) and set a shelf in the middle. Line 3 x baking trays with parchment/baking paper. </p>
<p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Take the dough out of the refrigerator and cut into half. Wrap half and return to the fridge. </p>
<p><strong>Step 9:</strong> Sprinkle a sheet of baking paper very lightly with flour. Place dough on top, sprinkle surface very lightly with flour. Place another sheet of baking paper on top. Roll dough out until 4mm / 1/6" thick using a rolling pin. As you work, flip and if paper is wrinkling, peel it off then put if back on, smoothing out wrinkles.</p>
<p><strong>Step 10:</strong> Use a gingerbread cookie cutter to cut out gingerbread men shapes, firmly pressing to cut all the way through. If the dough sticks to the cutter, dip it into flour. </p>
<p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Use a palette knife (or large knife) to transfer shapes onto baking sheet. Place 6 on the first sheet. Tidy edges if necessary using a butter knife.</p>
<p><strong>Step 12:</strong> Bake for 12 minutes (for classic light golden) or 14 minutes (dark golden and crisp). Then remove and cool fully on tray. </p>
<p><strong>Step 13:</strong> Gather scraps of dough, press together then roll out again. If dough is sticky, return to refrigerator and work on the other half of the dough instead. Repeat rolling out and cutting out. You should have 18 to 20 gingerbread men in total (depending on cutter size). </p>
<p><strong>Step 14:</strong> Fill and bake 2nd and 3rd tray with gingerbread men, 6 to 8 on each tray. I find the workflow that works best is baking one tray at a time ie. roll/cut-out/fill/bake one tray while you prepare the next. </p>
<p><strong>Step 15:</strong> Fully cool on trays, then decorate! Use a half batch of this any premade icing to pipe and stick on decorations (sets hard and doesn't soak into cookies). </p>
<p><strong>Step 16:</strong> Serve!</p>
